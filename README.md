##### This is free for anyone to use, and it has been commented on to help understanding where to change things to get the colors and content you want. This is mostly in index.html, but there are a couple comments in assets/css/templatemo-style.css as well.

### See original template here: 
[Reflux Template](https://templatemo.com/tm-531-reflux)


#### Note: The girlswhocodesite branch is an example of how the template can be adapted to fit your needs.
That version was created as an intial landing page for Girls Who Code at UNC Charlotte until our full website is developed.
